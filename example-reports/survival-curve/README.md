# Survival curve

## Purpose and scope
This repository aims to provide a Custom Report for creating a Survival Curve within Viedoc.

## Overview of a Survival Curve
This report displays a survival analysis using the Survival package, as well as a more complicated plot using the 'plotly' package.
This custom report generates the following output:

- Sub-report 'Survival Curve': A plot of the Kaplan-Meier model, with 95% confidence intervals.

- Sub-report 'Survival Table': A table with the plotted values.
