# Serious adverse events combined with demographic data

This report displays all the serious adverse events (SAEs) with the corresponding demographic data. It is an example of how data from two different forms can be combined into a single custom report, as well as flag missing data.

This custom report generates the following output:
- A table of AEs entered as Serious, combined with the subject's sex and age from the demographic form.
