# Ongoing adverse events report

This report displays all ongoing adverse events. This demonstrates a good example of how to filter data based on specific criteria, as well as how to create a report with two sub-reports.

This custom report generates the following output:
- Sub-report 'Ongoing AEs': A table of all adverse events (AEs) that are ongoing, sorted by start date (ascending).
- Sub-report 'Start Date > 30 days': A table of ongoing AEs with a start date of more than 30 days ago.
